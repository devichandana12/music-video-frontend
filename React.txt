basic concept

	-- reusable component based approach
	-- jsx:javascript xml  (combination of codes of js and xml)
	-- fast

two types of components

-- function based --> also know as stateless component --loading the structure--> rcfe
-- class based --> also know as sateful component   --- loading the structure --> rcc 

function based

-- Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form,
--  they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.
-- doesnt contain any default funtion for createing state



-- react hook -- pre-defined function    -->  They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
										 -->  Hooks can only be used in functional components, not in-class components.
										 -->  To create hook --> hook name should  start with "use" keyword
										 -->  hook is introdused after 16th version of react

										 why we use hook: to create state .In functional based component there is no predefined function to create state. so it uses hook to create state

					create a state using hook

					syntax 
					------

						use predefined-function()

						use state()
              
			  state creation syntax

			  		const [state_name,state_value_updation_function] = useState()
					





class based 

-- A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and                                                                                    	create a render function that returns a React element.
-- must have the render() method
-- contain default funtion for state creation



state 
-----
	-> state is used to store values( also, state has an advantage to transfer value)
	-> we can share state to child component

 porps 
------
	props is used to share data between parent and child
